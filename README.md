# Local install

You will need to first install OpenMC (0.15.3 or newer).


There are several methods but perhaps the quickest is to use this Pip extra index as it includes a recent version of OpenMC 0.15.3-dev (which is needed to run the app).


```bash
python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://shimwell.github.io/wheels openmc
```


Then you can install ```openmc_geometry_plot``` with pip

```bash
pip install openmc_geometry_plot
```


# Usage

After installing run the ```openmc_geometry_plot``` command from the terminal and the GUI should launch in a new browser window.
